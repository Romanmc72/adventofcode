# AdventOfCode

It's like advent but just for nerds who code. Check it out [here](https://adventofcode.com/) and get your own advent of code puzzle inputs. Feel free to work on your own solutions as well. Mine were done for the most part as fast as I could think about how. Not optimized for scalability or space/time complexity so buzz off and don't judge me. This is just a for-fun holiday thing.

## The Folder Layout

Each folder here corresponds to a year and day of advent. Check out the original web page that contained the prompt as well as the input I received and code I used to generate a solution.

## Thoughts


This is a place to transparently store the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) progress and solutions I worked on as I did the challenges day after day and year after year. I am placing these on Github as a way to keep a history of what I have done with respect to these challenges as well as a way to look back on how far I have come. I am writing this now after having come back to these challenges on the doorstep of the next set dropping for 2023. I had not (at the time of writing this README) even finished all of 2022. The holidays generally get busy so I never feasibly could complete these 1x per day without suffering loss of important relational capital. EXCUSES! But I do value some things more than the gold stars these puzzles dole out (though the dopamine hit from getting both stars is very real).

This is a judgement free zone. If you wanna roast my approach whatever idc, this is not out here for you then. If I can nail all 25 then I will try upping the difficulty by making it a code golf challenge as well or maybe try and do it in some esoteric language I have never heard of.
